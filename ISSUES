1. All paths are built on startup, which isn't necessary.
    Only tracks just groveled need to have paths built.

2. Listing directory contents for the root is very slow.
    To narrow the path search space, constraints need to be specified depending on the level in the directory tree.
    There's a hack in there for the default pattern, but that's it.

3. albumartist is only supported for MP3 and FLAC.
    Need to determine which, if any, other formats also can have support added.

4. Need to add logic to present only the best file format when multiple are available for a given track.
    Right now, all are presented side-by-side.
