1. Empty directories (ones made empty by file extension filtering) should not be shown.

2. Attributes on directories are wrong:
    a. Link counts are hard-coded to 1. Probably not an actual source of problems, but still ugly.

3. Compilation albums should show up under artists' directories (if we also have tracks with that artist as the albumartist).

4. Changes to configuration should not require rebuilding the whole database.
    a. Configuration must be stored in the DB for this to work.
    b. Changes to aliases will require rebuilding paths.

5. Multiple source directories should be allowed.
    a. This probably requires changing the database file table to specify absolute paths instead of relative to the backing FS path.
