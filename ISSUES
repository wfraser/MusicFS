1. Need to add logic to present only the best file format when multiple are available for a given track.
    Right now, all are presented side-by-side.
    Fixing this is a work in progress.
    a. The extension preference should be configurable at runtime.
    b. Tracks need to be considered equal only if artist, albumartist, album, title, track, and disc are the same
        i. right now it also considers Genre, which is an unreliable piece of metadata, so it doesn't work right.
        ii. Genre should be a property of the file, not of the track?
        iii. or should the track be an agglomeration of all the genres for its files?
        iv. Should this even try to support Genre, given how poor the data is?
    c. Empty directories (ones made empty by filtering) should not be shown.
        i. This might be expensive to compute...

2. Attributes on directories are wrong:
    a. Link counts are hard-coded to 1. Probably not an actual source of problems, but still ugly.
