1. Need to add logic to present only the best file format when multiple are available for a given track.
    Right now, all are presented side-by-side.
    Fixing this is a work in progress.
    a. The extension preference should be configurable at runtime.
    b. Empty directories (ones made empty by filtering) should not be shown.
        i. This might be expensive to compute...

2. Attributes on directories are wrong:
    a. Link counts are hard-coded to 1. Probably not an actual source of problems, but still ugly.
